# LetsChallengeCorona
As corona has its adverse effects all over the world and created a pandemic situation, it is the biggest real life problem for now to be solved. LCC here aware the people with the effects of coronavirus and help them in earning even in this lockdown. 
People will get all the details of rumors and fake news that is being spread in the entire country and they will get aware of those news. No such app exists with this feature but LCC has the feature where the collection of all the rumors will be there at one place. It will also help people and make them aware of the importance of social distancing and how it should be followed as it is the basic necessity of the situation and people are not taking it seriously. LCC has the feature to alert people about the red zone areas.  Peopleâ€™s live location will be traced and if the person enters the district then he will get notification of the number of corona patients in that district and will make him alert and aware. Which prevents the person to become the victim post carona.
It is also giving people a chance of working remotely. Due to lockdown, people have lost their way of earning and are in very traumatic situations. We are giving people such as tailors a platform to work from home and earn money. They will be asked to stitch masks and sell them in nearby hospitals or medical shops whose detail is given in the app and can earn money this way. As there is a shortage of masks and industries are unable to meet the demand, we can start using home made masks which are good enough and even giving us a chance for others to earn money.
